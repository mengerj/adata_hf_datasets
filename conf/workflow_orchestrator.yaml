# Workflow Orchestrator Configuration
# This config contains settings for the workflow orchestrator only
# Dataset configs should be specified separately via command line

# =============================================================================
# WORKFLOW MODE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
workflow:
  # Set to true to run locally instead of via SSH
  local_mode: false

  # Transfer mode configuration
  # Set to true to use local scratch storage with transfers between clusters (faster processing, slower transfers)
  # Set to false to use shared filesystem directly (slower processing, no transfer overhead)
  # This allows performance comparison between local scratch + transfers vs shared filesystem
  enable_transfers: true

  # SSH connection settings for CPU cluster
  # Using SSH aliases from ~/.ssh/config (handles ProxyJump automatically)
  cpu_login:
    host: "imbi13" # SSH alias that resolves through biom5
    user: "menger" # Use the user from SSH config

  # SSH connection settings for GPU cluster
  # Using SSH aliases from ~/.ssh/config (handles ProxyJump automatically)
  gpu_login:
    host: "imbi_gpu_H100" # SSH alias that resolves through biom5
    user: "menger" # Use the user from SSH config

  # SLURM partition names (from actual cluster configuration)
  cpu_partition: "slurm" # CPU partition on imbi13
  gpu_partition: "gpu" # GPU partition on imbi_gpu_H100

  # Job polling interval (seconds)
  poll_interval: 3600

  # Timeout for job completion (seconds, 0 = no timeout)
  job_timeout: 0

  # Output directory configuration
  # This is the base directory where all workflow outputs and logs will be stored
  # The actual workflow directory will be: {output_directory}/{date}/workflow_{job_id}/
  output_directory: "/home/menger/git/adata_hf_datasets/outputs"

# =============================================================================
# ORCHESTRATOR SETTINGS

# Force flag to skip config synchronization validation
force: false

# Dataset config name to use (will be overridden by command line)
dataset_config_name: "dataset_cellxgene_pseudo_bulk_35k"
